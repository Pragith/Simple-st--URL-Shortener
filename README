Version: 1.0


~~~ Works only on Chrome as of now ~~~


Demo : http://pragith.net/url

Description:

This is a very simple and easy to use URL Shortener written in PHP, HTML & Javascript.
It uses jQuery for displaying messages & GET operations.
Also uses mod_rewrite for tags. 

!!! Make sure mod_rewrite is switched ON in your Apache server !!!

Installaion:
1) Edit config.php located in "_" directory
2) Go to <URL>/install.php


Upcoming changes:

-Reduce length of automatically generated tags
-Styling (if you fork and do it, I'll kiss you!)
-Informative messages to the user in install.php (feeling sleepy to do it now)
